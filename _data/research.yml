    ​In June 2021, I joined the Medical Image Analysis group in 
    [**Data Science and Machine Learning Lab**] (http://ml.dml.ir/) 
    as a research assistant under the supervision of 
    [Prof. Rabiee] (http://sina.sharif.edu/~rabiee/). 
    My project was the **Interpretability of Segmentation Models** with a focus on medical applications. 
    I have tried to find new and innovative ways to make segmentation models interpretable using the legacy methods in classification. 
    As a solution, I developed a wrapper function that performs the classification interpretability methods pixel-wise and then combines them using a flexible pattern. 
    Currently, I am working on the evaluation of the interpretation of segmentation.

    ​​In November 2020, I joined the Medical Image Analysis group in **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Lab** as a research assistant under the supervision of 
    [Prof. Rohban](http://sharif.edu/~rohban/). 
    My project was the **Design of An Automatic Orthodontic Diagnosis and Cephalometric Analysis Tool**. 
    I developed several semi-supervised and self-supervised models to solve this problem since our labelled dataset was very small and we had a large unlabelled dataset. 
    I also tried to solve this problem from another angle: I split the problem into two separate landmark detection and classification tasks. 
    I developed several CNN regression and segmentation models for landmark detection. 
    Currently, I work on error analysis of these models to improve them.

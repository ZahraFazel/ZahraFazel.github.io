										<h3>About Me</h3>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> 
									Hello! I’m Zahra Fazel, and I am a senior undergraduate student at the Sharif University of Technology. 
									My main interests are machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in computer vision, medical image analysis and natural language processing. 
									For more details, please see my <a href="https://zahrafazel.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>
									</br>
									I intend to widen my knowledge in these areas by learning more about their theoretical and mathematical side and by practical exploitation of these methods in real-life problems. 
									My research goal is to introduce innovative approaches based on mathematical reasoning that solve practical problems in computer vision with a focus on medical applications.

										June 2021 - Present
									</h6>
									<p>
									​In June 2021, I joined the Medical Image Analysis group in 
									<a href="http://ml.dml.ir/" target="_blank"><b>Data Science and Machine Learning Lab</b></a> 
									as a research assistant under the supervision of 
									<a href="http://sina.sharif.edu/~rabiee/" target="_blank">Prof. Rabiee</a>. 
									My project was the <b>Interpretability of Segmentation Models</b> with a focus on medical applications.
									I have tried to find new and innovative ways to make segmentation models interpretable using the legacy methods in classification. 
									As a solution, I developed a wrapper function that performs the classification interpretability methods pixel-wise and then combines them using a flexible pattern. 
									Currently, I am working on the evaluation of the interpretation of segmentation.

									<p>
									​In November 2020, I joined the Medical Image Analysis group in 
									<b>Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Lab</b> 
									as a research assistant under the supervision of 
									<a href="http://sharif.edu/~rohban/" target="_blank">Prof. Rohban</a>. 
									My project was the <b>Design of An Automatic Orthodontic Diagnosis and Cephalometric Analysis Tool</b>. 
									I developed several semi-supervised and self-supervised models to solve this problem since our labelled dataset was very small and we had a large unlabelled dataset. 
									I also tried to solve this problem from another angle: I split the problem into two separate landmark detection and classification tasks. 
									I developed several CNN regression and segmentation models for landmark detection. 
									Currently, I work on error analysis of these models to improve them.
